# DNN for Qubit Mapping
We reproduce, extend and benchmark the DNN model for Qubit Mapping from [1]

Specifically, our contributions are:
* extended the DNN model from 5-qubits to 7-qubits by expanding the architecture naturally
* created a new dataset of 7-qubit random circuits, following the dataset format as described
* added Sabrelayout to the set of IBM algorithms for label generation
* ran the reimplemented DNN model on the newly produced dataset and reproduced results similar to what was expected
* created a new dataset of 7-qubit circuits of practical design and ran the DNN model on it without retraining to see if DNN can generalize
* benchmarked DNN against
    * the 2 best performing ML in [1]: RF-Gini and SVM-RBF
    * a shallow multiclass classifier
    * a geometrically motivated GNN model
